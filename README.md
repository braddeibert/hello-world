First Ever GitHub Repository: A little about me, how I found coding (UPDATED 9/14/19)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hey everyone! My name is Brad, and I'm a junior at the University of Montana studying Computer Science. 

As you may have read in my short bio, I'm originally from a little town called Kalispell in the Flathead Valley. In 7th grade, I moved to a closeby town called Columbia Falls where I stayed for several years. I've also recently lived in northern California and east Texas. 

I graduated from Columbia Falls High School in the summer of 2016, after which I went on to complete an Associate of Science at Flathead Valley Community College in the spring of 2018. 

Some things I don't want to live without include good workouts, good views, good company, the Good Book, and my beautiful fiancee Alicia. If you've got the Packers or Lakers on TV I'll be over as soon as possible with drinks & snacks in hand.


If (you are curious how I found myself in love with coding) keep reading;

Funny, it was actually in a complete stumble upon which I found programming. 

I had nothing to do with a single line of code before my sophomore year in college - well, unless you count opening up Chrome DevTools and changing website headings to profanity as a freshman in high school, that is. 

This is because there wasn't much of a tech influence in the area where I grew up, so there were no course offerings at my high school, and I never found it on my own. It wasn't until going into my second year of college, when I had no clue what I was going to pursue for a career, that my academic advisor presented me with two choices: engineering or computer science. Math had always come easy to me, so these were the paths she recommended I choose from. It was then, after going on a little intuition, that I made one of the best decisions of my life and declared a major in computer science. Sorry engineering majors, I promise it's nothing personal.

Since then, I've been doing my best to keep learning and become well rounded. Not only in the beginnings of my career, but in all aspects of life in general.

Thanks for taking a moment to read more about me, I'd love to know more about you!

Lastly, hello GitHub world!!!

# TL;DR I'm from a small town in Montana. I stumbled upon coding as a college sophomore and have been loving it ever since.
