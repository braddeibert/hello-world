First GitHub Respository: ABOUT ME

Here's some background on me!

I'm a young computer science student from the beautiful Flathead Valley in Montana. Currently living in East TX, with plans to be in CA. Things outside of tech & the programming realm that I enjoy include fitness, health & nutrition, finance & economics, philosophy, sports, and church on Sundays. Extra note on the sports mention: I'm an avid fan of the Los Angeles Lakers & Green Bay Packers.

I found my interest and desire to pursue programming by somewhat of dumb luck going into my second year of college. After graduating high school I went straight to the local community college without a sense of direction, being told that "it's okay" to not have it figured out yet (it isn't). Since I hadn't declared a major, I spent my first year filling general course requirements--none of them related to programming. After that year, I knew it was time to get serious about committing to a career path. And like lots of people my age, I was scared. But even so, I knew that I had always enjoyed mathematics and consistently excelled in them. So why not see where math could take me? I set up a meeting with my advisor. There, Her and I narrowed it down to either engineering or computer science.

Engineering didn't gain any traction with me from the start--and that's no offense. On the other hand, I figured that studying computer science was a powerful and promising path to take. This not only because of the influence technology has in today's world (it's everywhere & growing), but also considering the opportunity for creative expression that is offered with programming. An unignorable part of me has always really wanted to create things.

Trusting my thoughts on the seemingly towering decision, I declared a computer science major and began taking the offered courses my second year. I was booked for both semesters with all the math and programming courses I could take--AND I LOVED IT. I really have to give thanks in big part to the passions from two amazing professors in math and computer science, as it was from them my passion was born. Thought I'm unfortunately not attending college at this time, I'm excited to continue learning as much as I can to become the best programmer & mathematician that I can possibly be.

I hope this read helps you get to know me, and I'm excited to get to know you all!
